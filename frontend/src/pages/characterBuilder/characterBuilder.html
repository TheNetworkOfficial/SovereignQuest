              <h2>Welcome to the Character Builder</h2>
              <p>
                SovereignQuest, the infamous tabletop RPG, is at its core a game of swords and sorcery—where valiant knights clash with mighty dragons, cunning rogues flit 
                through the shadows, and wizened sages channel the power of ancient gods. It is a realm of myth and magic, brought to life by the camaraderie and imagination of 
                those who come together with adventure in their hearts.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before you begin your journey, you will need to create your character. This character will serve as your avatar within the world of SovereignQuest, growing and 
                evolving as you play. Your stats—whether generated here in our Character Builder or rolled with your Dungeon Master—represent your “god-given abilities,” defining 
                the limits of your strength, swiftness, intellect, and more. Similarly, details such as your appearance, backstory, and other distinctive elements can be crafted 
                by you, randomly generated, or assigned by your Dungeon Master.
              </p> 
                
              <p>
                Within the game you are your character, guided by the morals, philosophies, and ambitions you set for yourself (alignment). You can interact with the other 
                players gathered in your Moot Hall (lobby), and the wider world around you, crafted by your The Dungeon Master, who has the part of "everyone else", bringing the 
                world around you to life, and will present you with a variety of new characters to talk too, drink with, adventure beside, and fight against. Within the world of 
                SovereignQuest you will become a thespian on of a grand stage made of the virtual pen - acquiring gold, knowledge, and experience as you quest on your journey to 
                master SovereignQuest!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> While any character may be invited into private Moot Halls or join in-person games at the table’s discretion, please remember that only those 
                created through this Character Builder are eligible for officially licensed tournaments and competitive modes. This ensures a fair and consistent standard for all 
                challengers who dare to test their mettle in the world of SovereignQuest.

              <p>
                Before you embark upon your grand adventure, you must choose the racial heritage of your character. Within the world of SovereignQuest, a vast panoply of sentient 
                beings walk beneath sun and star, but as a newcomer, you may initially choose only from among the five prominent “foundational races” that dominate the continents. 
                Each of these lineages brings its own rich heritage, distinct traits, and innate predispositions for certain skills, shaping not only how you interact with others, 
                but the tools you will have at your disposal as you navigate perilous dungeons, negotiate through the realms, or outwit cunning foes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though the foundational races are the most prominent of the land, they are not its sum. As your journey progresses, other races—more elusive and rare—may become 
                accessible to you for subsequent character builds. The nature and variety of these additional race selections will depend on the choices you make throughout your 
                journey, and range from sub-racial selections to entirely new species, rewarding the most adventurous of players with the greatest rewards. In this way, new 
                horizons of possibility open themselves to you over multiple playthroughs, ensuring that the legacy of your most epic moments extend far beyond a single campaign.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider each race’s gifts and burdens thoughtfully, and when your choice aligns with the vision you hold for your new persona, proceed by selecting a race from the right. 
                Once chosen, more details will appear below to guide your next steps. Then, click “Next” to see the sub-racial options available for your character.
